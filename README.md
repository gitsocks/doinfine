## Patterns

### State Machines

**DoinFine** uses finite state machines to handle business logic.

> A finite state machine is a mathematical model of computation that describes the behavior of a system that can be in only one state at any given time.

The state machines in **DoinFine** are implemented using [`XState`](https://xstate.js.org/docs/).

You can read more about **DoinFine** state machine implementation [here](./src/machines/state-machines.md).
